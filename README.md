#       Conner's Audio Plugin Template :)
A relatively stable work-in-progress template for a
simple audio plugin using JUCE with CMake.
<br/>

Latest Version 0.1.3
<br/><br/><br/>

##      Info
This template uses JUCE with CMake and CPM to easily add on any
extra dependencies and make building for cross-platform a
relatively simple task.
<br/><br/><br/>

##        Sentiment
This is what I will be using to start any of my own JUCE
projects. I wanted to make something pretty light and hard
to mess up because I've tried so many times to start plugin
development and gotten discouraged.

Hopefully this might make it easy for someone else to get
started too, I'll try and leave good comments and make little
tools that make the process doable.
